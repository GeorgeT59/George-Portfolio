<h3>Old News</h3>
<br>
The main page was getting a little cluttered, so I decided an 'old' news. This will give you an insight of what I've been working on in the past.
<br>
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: September 1st, 2020</strong>, about a week ago I started learning Angular.
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: August 14th, 2020</strong>, I got Selenium to work with Python (PyCharm IDE) to search for jobs for me. Just a fun little experiment, and I'm glad I can use Selenium with C# and Python.
<br>
<strong>UDPATE: July 28th, 2020</strong>, I'm making a fun little personal website - nothing insane, but it'll be a fun little project; more details later on.
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: July 2nd, 2020 </strong>, I have completed IBM's Pre-Apprenticeship Software Engineer program, you can view my badges and certification here: <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/george-tabet/badges">My Badges & Certifications.</a>
<br>
- And of course modifying this page to rehone my skills and keep people posted with Github, HTML, and maybe more.
