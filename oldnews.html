<br>
<strong>UPDATE: October 5th, 2020</strong>, Started learning some Xamarin.
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: September 26th, 2020</strong>, I added an <a href="https://georget59.github.io/George-Portfolio/oldnews.html">old news</a> section to view past updates, and also started learning whitehat ethical hacking, started in Sept. 22nd, 2020. [Also added oldnews link below.]
