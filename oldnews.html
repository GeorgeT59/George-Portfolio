<h3>Old News</h3>
<br>
The main page was getting a little cluttered, so I decided an 'old' news. This will give you an insight of what I've been working on in the past.

<br>
<strong>[**No longer working here**]October 23rd, 2020</strong>, Well I got a new position; I probably won't be updating this page as much. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-tabet-programmer/">LinkedIn profile</a> for more details.
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: October 5th, 2020</strong>, Started learning some Xamarin.
<br>
<strong>UPDATE: September 26th, 2020</strong>, I added an <a href="https://georget59.github.io/George-Portfolio/oldnews.html">old news</a> section to view past updates, and also started learning whitehat ethical hacking, started in Sept. 22nd, 2020. [Also added oldnews link below.]
