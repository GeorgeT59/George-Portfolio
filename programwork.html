<h3>Programming experience.</h3>
<br>
<br>
Besides my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Youngstown State University, I also have worked at Turning Technologies - where I learned IntelliJ, BitBucket, Jira, some GRAILS, and more on the fly.

<strong>Java Project</strong>
<br>
<br>
Back in 2017 I tried to make a Japanese game - it's an unfinished Java game I made for a Hackathon - pure Java. The project was a little too ambitious for a Hackathon.

Right now I also do CodeWars challenges almost daily; I've completed over 300 challenges there. <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/George_T/badges/large">My Code Wars badge.</a> Most of the challenges that I solve there are C#, but I do have some solved in SQL, Java, and even some C++.
<br>
<br>
I chose C# for a couple of reasons - here's some:
<br>
<br>
1.) I can use it with Unity.
<br>
<br>
2.) I can create some pretty good programs with C# rather quickly.
<br>
<br>
3.) If I focus on 1 language, I should be able to switch to another fairly quick. For example switching from C# to Java should be relatively quick. [So Generics, Delegates, and References are some examples that can transfer to any other language that supports them.]
<br>
<br>
<b>Project:</b> Here's a link to my project that I created in C#, I call it MOGO - it answers questions based on what the user types. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tDL-RhjuXX1fW-cA-nvc48TY5XDs_xql/view?usp=sharing">MOGO Project</a>

<br>
<strong>Programming Languages used:</strong> I've used C#, VB.NET, Java, C++, Python, and PHP.
<br>
<br>
I have a little bit of SQL experience, some Javascript experience (thankfully it's quite similar to C# in syntax), and I've used various IDEs (like IntelliJ, NetBeans, Visual Studio, etc.). Always keep learning.
