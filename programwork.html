<h3>Programming experience.</h3>
<br>
<br>
Besides my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Youngstown State University, I also have worked at Turning Technologies - where I learned IntelliJ, BitBucket, Jira, some GRAILS, and more on the fly. 
<br>
<br>
From the IBM pre-apprenticeship I have earned 4 badges and 1 certification of completion, which you can view here: <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/george-tabet">IBM Badges earned.</a>
<br>
<br>
Here's a simplified version of my CS skills:
<br>
<br>
<strong>C#</strong> - I've used LINQ, lambda expressions, and collections. Practicing more lambda expressions with LINQ.
<br>
<br>
<strong>C++/Java</strong> - I know the fundamentals, if-else, input, loops, etc. My Java score on Pluralsight is 113, which you can view here: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/George-T5">Java Score.</a>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Python </strong> - I have a Pluralsight score of 153, which puts me at proficient. Which you can view on my StackOverflow account: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/George-T5">Python Score.</a>
<br>
<br>
<strong>VB.NET</strong> - Can create simple apps with Visual Studio.
<br>
<br>
<strong>SQL</strong> - I know the fundamentals, so the types of JOIN clauses, the basic clauses (FROM, WHERE, SELECT, etc.), and functions like MIN, MAX, SUM, etc.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Azure</strong> - I was studying for the Azure Fundamental certification, so I have some skills using Azure.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Selenium</strong> - Can create automated scripts to go to websites, type in text boxes, and select buttons or drop down menus.

Quick reference of my Programming Skills:
<br>
<br>
<strong>C#:</strong> I can use generic collections (Lists, HashSets, Dictionaries), some LINQ, some lambda expressions, and know about delegates, recursion, ternary operators, etc.
<br>
<br>
<strong>SQL:</strong> I know the SQL fundamentals, simple clauses, the different types of JOINs, and functions like Min, Max, Sum, etc.

<strong>Java Project</strong>
<br>
<br>
Back in 2017 I tried to make a Japanese game - it's an unfinished Java game I made for a Hackathon - pure Java. The project was a little too ambitious for a Hackathon.

Right now I also do CodeWars challenges almost daily; I've completed over 300 challenges there. <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/George_T/badges/large">My Code Wars badge.</a> Most of the challenges that I solve there are C#, but I do have some solved in SQL, Java, and even some C++.
<br>
<br>
I chose C# for a couple of reasons - here's some:
<br>
<br>
1.) I can use it with Unity.
<br>
<br>
2.) I can create some pretty good programs with C# rather quickly.
<br>
<br>
3.) If I focus on 1 language, I should be able to switch to another fairly quick. For example switching from C# to Java should be relatively quick. [So Generics, Delegates, and References are some examples that can transfer to any other language that supports them.]
<br>
<br>
<b>Project:</b> Here's a link to my project that I created in C#, I call it MOGO - it answers questions based on what the user types. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rdojlemjldpnqs0/MOGO.exe?dl=0">MOGO Project</a>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Programming Languages used:</strong> I've used C#, VB.NET, Java, C++, Python, and PHP.
<br>
<br>
I have a little bit of SQL experience, some Javascript experience (thankfully it's quite similar to C# in syntax), and I've used various IDEs (like IntelliJ, NetBeans, Visual Studio, etc.). Always keep learning.
