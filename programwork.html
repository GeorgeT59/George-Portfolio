<h3>Programming experience.</h3>
<br>
<br>
Besides my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Youngstown State University, I also have worked at Turning Technologies - where I learned IntelliJ, BitBucket, Jira, some GRAILS, and more on the fly.
<br>
I also do CodeWars challenges almost daily; right now I've completed well over 250 challenges there. <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/George_T/badges/large">My Code Wars bagde</a> Most of the challenges that I solve there are C#, but I do have some solved in SQL, Java, and even some C++/Python.
<br>
I chose C# for a couple of reasons - here's some:
<br>
<br>
1.) I can use it with Unity.
<br>
<br>
2.) I can create some pretty good programs with C# rather quickly.
<br>
<br>
3.) If I focus on 1 language, I should be able to switch to another fairly quick. For example switching from C# to Java should be relatively quick.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Programming Languages used:</strong> I've used C#, VB.NET, Java, C++, Python, and PHP (if you count that).
<br>
<br>
I have a little bit of SQL experience, some Javascript experience (thankfully it's quite similar to C# in syntax), and I've used various IDEs (like IntelliJ, NetBeans, Visual Studio, etc.). Always keep learning.
