Web Design experience.
<br>
<br>
I used to work as Phantom Firework's graphic/web designer.
<br>
I was in charge of maintaining Phantom Fireworks, their Hockey website, and even sending out the newsletter (and making the newsletter's links work in Adobe Fireworks).
<br>
<br>
I also had some personal projects that I'd like to get back up one day. I used ASP Headers/Footers, and a little bit of Javascript for my personal projects. I still have the code, but right now it's on my backlog of projects.
