<h3>Course work.</h3>
<br>
<br>
Here's a list and description of some of the computer science courses that I've taken at Youngstown State University. [I needed 12 SH for the Upper Division classes to earn my CS degree - I took 21 SH because it's fun to learn CS topics.]
<br>
<br>
<strong>Fundamental Programming & Problem Solving 1 & 2:</strong> The first class was Python, where I learned the fundamentals of programming (while loops, if statements, functions, etc.) and the second part is where I first learned C++.
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Python & C++ fundamentals.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Advanced OOP:</strong> This is where I was learning all things Java, which I was lucky because at the time I was also getting paid to learn Java at Turning Technologies at the same time. So Java, OOP concepts, and NetBeans.
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Java, OOP Concepts, and NetBeans.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Data Structures & Objects:</strong> This is where I learned about data structures like stacks and queues. More with C++.
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> More C++, OOP, and data structures like Stacks and Queues.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Software Tools & Practices:</strong> This is where I learned a bunch of different software tools, like Doxygen, Git & Github (though I used Github before this class), some Regex, and more. [I do wish I learned more Regex.]
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Doxygen, some Regex, Git & Github, Javadoc, and more.
<br>
<br>
<strong>E-Commerce Programming:</strong> I already knew HTML before, so this is where I learned PHP, used my already known HTML experience, and some SQL to make a store where you login and purchase products (Mine was a muffin shop).
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> PHP basics and some SQL (I already knew HTML at the time.)
<br>
<br>
<strong>Visual OOP:</strong> This was one of my favorite classes; it's where I learned the Visual Studio IDE and VB.NET. I was lucky again because I was learning C# and Visual Studio at work. A lot of overlap with Advanced OOP.
<br>
<strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Visual Studio, VB.NET, some SQL.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Computer Project: </strong> This was the capstone class. I created a login system in VB.NET with some SQL, and Access where the data was stored. It even would even log the time and day the user signed in.
