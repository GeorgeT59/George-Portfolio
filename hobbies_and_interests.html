<h3>Hobbies and interests.</h3>
<br>
I decided to make this page to list my hobbies and interests.
<br>
As of Sept. 2020.
<br>
Here's a simple list:
<br>
<br>
- Game Development: I've practiced using Unity to make some platforming games; it's fun (and you can use C#), but there's a lot of concepts to learn.
<br>
- Programming: I'm currently a member of 3 CS Slacks, 5 Discord servers (Python, C#, Java, in general, and game development), and 10 subreddits (ranging from languages, to Git, to general) - oh and I'm subscribed to a couple of CS Youtube channels. I'm also on CodeWars and StackOverflow daily.
<br>
- Video Games: With all the programming channels, video games was a given. I like new video games, but do go back to SNES games every now and then.
<br>
- Anime: I have about 230 anime that I plan to watch; even had my own anime review website back in 2008.
<br>
- Comics: I've been into the Marvel/DC universes (way before the MCU); I even tried the DC Univere app (day 1) and Marvel Unlimted. Also other publishers like Dark Horse or small indie comics too. 
<br>
- I'll also be nice to get back into chess, learning Japanese (and yes I can read and speak the language, albeit at a beginner level), Yoga, and cooking when I have the time.
<br>
<br>
Most of my time is used learning new programming concepts, video games, and programming challenges.
