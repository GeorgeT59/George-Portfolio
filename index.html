<br>
<br>
Welcome to my Github test portfolio, just giving you some things I'm currently working on:
    <br>
    <br>
    - Started studying for Azure certification.
    <br>
    - Been practicing sprite creation/animation for Unity.
    <br>
    - Bought a Rapsberry Pi Zero W that I'll have fun with.
    <br>
    - I practice C# every day (since Feb. 13th, 2019 though I did take a 60 day break to earn my bachelor's degree - even made a program that keeps track of how many days I've studied C#.)
    <br>
    - And last, but not least, modifying this page to rehone my skills
    in Github, HTML, and maybe more.

<strong>Hobbies: </strong> Video games, anime, when I have time it'll be nice to get back into chess & continue learning Japnaese, practicing digital drawing, and technology as a whole.
