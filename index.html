Welcome to my Github test portfolio, just giving you some things I'm currently working on:
    
    - Started studying for Azure certification.
    - Been practicing sprite creation/animation for Unity.
    - Bought a Rapsberry Pi Zero W that I'll have fun with.
    - Still practice C#.
    - And last, but not least, modifying this page to rehone my skills
    in Github, HTML, and maybe more.
