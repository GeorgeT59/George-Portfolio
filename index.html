Welcome to my Github portfolio, here's some things I'm currently working on:
    <br>
    <br>
<!--

    <br>

    <br>

<!--
    <strong>May 1st, 2021</strong>, I've been so busy; since I'm now a Software Developer for a Fortune 1000 company I just haven't had much time to post here. So that explains where I've been.
-->
    <strong>May 31st, 2022</strong> Decided to update my timeline for those interested: <a href="https://georget59.github.io/Programming-Timeline/">Yearly timeline.</a>
    <br>
    <strong>February 14th, 2022</strong>, Feels good to get back into VB.NET programming with Git at work. I'm going to need to work on my Git skills more; mainly for fun. .NET and fundamentals all the way.
    <br>
    <strong>January 22nd, 2022</strong>, I've been quite busy, with a new career as a software developer I had minimal amount of time to post here. Long and short is I'm a C# Software Engineer; so I'm studying some C#, XML, VB.NET, and other Microsoft tech stacks & software principals; like Unit Testing.
    <br>
    <strong>November 5th, 2021</strong>, It's been quite a while. Been working a little on front-end with CSS & React. Also am learning about JSON - trying to expand my technology skill set.
    <br>
    <strong>August 29th, 2021</strong>, Made a program with Python and Tkinter - it's a checklist app. Can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeT59/CheckList">https://github.com/GeorgeT59/CheckList</a>
    <br>
    <strong>August 25th, 2021</strong>, Got around to using Github's new command line token authentication - it's interesting. 
    <br>
    Also you can view my Unity game in action here: <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeT59/AdventureGameProto">Unity game animation.</a>
    <br>
    <!--<strong>August 14th, 2021</strong>, Made a simpler website to soley showcase my skills; which you can view here: <a href="https://georget59.github.io/GeorgeShowcase/main.html">Showcase website.</a>
    <br>
    Also I'm working on a video game in Unity. [Just a nice demo that I hope to upload someday.]
    <br>
    <strong>March 27th, 2021</strong>, Yesterday I finished a little project of mine that I call SpeedRead. You can check that out here: <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeT59/SpeedRead">https://github.com/GeorgeT59/SpeedRead</a>
    <br>
    <strong>March 14th, 2021</strong>, Started using pure Git commands with Github for various projects. I made a programming timeline for myself, which you can view here: <a href="https://georget59.github.io/Programming-Timeline/">https://georget59.github.io/Programming-Timeline/</a>
    <br>
    <strong>February 27th, 2021</strong>, yesterday I started practicing Javascript by creating a calculator with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You can view that project here: <a href="https://georget59.github.io/Calculator/">Calculator Project</a>. This was also a great opportunity to upload it with pure git commands, which I did and hopefully will continue to do.
    <br>
    <strong>UPDATE: October 9th, 2020</strong>, Added a "looking for employment" mention at the top of this page and will update accordingly, also still learning Xamarin/XAML. 
    <br>
    <!--Postponed my Angular in favor of Selenium-
    - Selenium practice, I will say that running your first successful automation script is quite fun.
    <br>
    <br>
    - With Selenium I can now navigate to a url, select dropdown menu, type in a text box, and click on a button - all with automation.->

<!--
Everyday I practice the following:
<br>
<br>
1.) C# challenges, usually via codewars (check out details in the programming section below).
<br>
<br>
2.) Azure fundamentals, as stated above I'm trying to be certified in Azure.
    <br>
    <br>
3.) Digital drawing and sprite creation - both with a digtal drawing tablet. (I plan on combing my C# + Unity with my sprite creation for some basic video game creation).-->
