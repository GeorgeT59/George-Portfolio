Welcome to my Github portfolio, here's some things I'm currently working on:
    <br>
    <br>
<!--
    <del>- Started studying for Azure certification.</del> Update: I decided to put studying Azure on hiatus.
    <br>
    - Been practicing sprite creation/animation for Unity.
    <br>
    - Bought a Rapsberry Pi Zero W that I'll have fun with. [Postponed.]
    <br>
-->
    - I practice C# every day (since Feb. 13th, 2019 though I did take a 60 day break to earn my bachelor's degree - even made a program that keeps track of how many days I've studied C#.)
    <br>
    <strong>March 14th, 2021</strong>, Started using pure Git commands with Github for various projects. I made a programming timeline for myself, which you can view here: <a href="https://georget59.github.io/Programming-Timeline/">https://georget59.github.io/Programming-Timeline/</a>
    <br>
    <strong>February 27th, 2021</strong>, yesterday I started practicing Javascript by creating a calculator with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You can view that project here: <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeT59/Calculator">Calculator Project</a>. This was also a great opportunity to upload it with pure git commands, which I did and hopefully will continue to do.
    <br>
    <strong>February 3rd, 2021</strong>, yesterday I studied a little bit of Regex; but I also want to start preparing for the Azure certification (The AZ-900 exam).
    <br>
    <strong>January 9th, 2021</strong>, well I updated this page a little, moved some old news to the old news page, and added my Github projects at the top and in the <a href="https://georget59.github.io/George-Portfolio/programwork.html">Programming Skills section.</a>
    <br>
    <!--<strong>UPDATE: October 9th, 2020</strong>, Added a "looking for employment" mention at the top of this page and will update accordingly, also still learning Xamarin/XAML. 
    <br>
    <!--Postponed my Angular in favor of Selenium-
    - Selenium practice, I will say that running your first successful automation script is quite fun.
    <br>
    <br>
    - With Selenium I can now navigate to a url, select dropdown menu, type in a text box, and click on a button - all with automation.->

<!--
Everyday I practice the following:
<br>
<br>
1.) C# challenges, usually via codewars (check out details in the programming section below).
<br>
<br>
2.) Azure fundamentals, as stated above I'm trying to be certified in Azure.
    <br>
    <br>
3.) Digital drawing and sprite creation - both with a digtal drawing tablet. (I plan on combing my C# + Unity with my sprite creation for some basic video game creation).-->

<strong>Hobbies: </strong> Video games, anime, when I have time it'll be nice to get back into chess, practicing digital drawing, and technology as a whole.
