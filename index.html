Welcome to my Github test portfolio, here's some things I'm currently working on:
    <br>
    <br>
<!--
    <del>- Started studying for Azure certification.</del> Update: I decided to put studying Azure on hiatus.
    <br>
    - Been practicing sprite creation/animation for Unity.
    <br>-->
    - Bought a Rapsberry Pi Zero W that I'll have fun with. [Postponed.]
    <br>
    - I practice C# every day (since Feb. 13th, 2019 though I did take a 60 day break to earn my bachelor's degree - even made a program that keeps track of how many days I've studied C#.)
    <br>
    <strong>UPDATE: September 1st, 2020</strong>, about a week ago I started learning Angular.
    <br>
    <strong>UPDATE: August 14th, 2020</strong>, I got Selenium to work with Python (PyCharm IDE) to search for jobs for me. Just a fun little experiment, and I'm glad I can use Selenium with C# and Python.
    <br>
    <strong>UDPATE: July 28th, 2020</strong>, I'm making a fun little personal website - nothing insane, but it'll be a fun little project; more details later on.
    <br>
    <strong>UPDATE: July 2nd, 2020 </strong>, I have completed IBM's Pre-Apprenticeship Software Engineer program, you can view my badges and certification here: <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/george-tabet/badges">My Badges & Certifications.</a>
    <br>
    - And of course modifying this page to rehone my skills and keep people posted with Github, HTML, and maybe more.
    <br>
    <!--Postponed my Angular in favor of Selenium-
    - Selenium practice, I will say that running your first successful automation script is quite fun.
    <br>
    <br>
    - With Selenium I can now navigate to a url, select dropdown menu, type in a text box, and click on a button - all with automation.->

<!--
Everyday I practice the following:
<br>
<br>
1.) C# challenges, usually via codewars (check out details in the programming section below).
<br>
<br>
2.) Azure fundamentals, as stated above I'm trying to be certified in Azure.
    <br>
    <br>
3.) Digital drawing and sprite creation - both with a digtal drawing tablet. (I plan on combing my C# + Unity with my sprite creation for some basic video game creation).-->

<strong>Hobbies: </strong> Video games, anime, when I have time it'll be nice to get back into chess, practicing digital drawing, and technology as a whole.
